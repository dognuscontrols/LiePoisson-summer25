This repository contains a few results highlighting the efficiency of the implicit midpoint rule for numerical integration oiver off-the-shelf schemes such as Runge-Kutta. The systems in hand belongs to the Lie-Poisson class, i.e. the Poisson tensor in the Hamiltonian dynamics is linear in the phase space variable z. For canonical Hamiltonian systems, the midpoint rule is known to preserve the Poisson structure. But here, we validate the findings of Austin, Krishnaprasad and Wang (1993) and numerically verify that the aforementioned scheme behaves as an 'almost' Poisson automorphism. Since the error term contains three and higher order terms, linear and quadratic invariants (Hamiltonians and Casimirs) are preserved up to machine precision.
