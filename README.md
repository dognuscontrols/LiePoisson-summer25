This repository contains a few results highlighting the efficiency of the implicit midpoint rule for numerical integration over off-the-shelf schemes such as Runge-Kutta. The systems in hand (i.e. freely spinning rigid body, unicycle) belong to the Lie-Poisson class, i.e. the Poisson tensor in the Hamiltonian dynamics is linear in the phase space variable z. For canonical Hamiltonian systems, where the Poisson tensor is a constant, the midpoint rule is known to preserve the Poisson structure exactly. Here, we validate the findings of Austin, Krishnaprasad and Wang (1993) and numerically verify that the aforementioned scheme behaves as an 'almost' Poisson automorphism in case of Lie-Poisson systems, i.e. the simplest class of noncanonical systems. The error term contains three and higher order terms, linear and quadratic invariants (Hamiltonians and Casimirs) are preserved up to machine precision.
